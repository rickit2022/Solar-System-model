# **Solar-System-model**
A Java-Swing GUI based program that replicates the solar system to visualizing the dynamics of planetary objects involved.

### Description
The program uses real astronomical data to accurately simulate the movement of planetary objects. It takes into account factors such as orbital paths, gravitational forces(size), and planetary velocities to create a realistic depiction of the solar system's dynamics on a 2D interface.
